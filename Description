Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication

Strassen’s Matrix Multiplication is the divide and conquer approach to solve the 

matrix multiplication problems. The usual matrix multiplication method 

multiplies each row with each column to achieve the product matrix. The time 

complexity taken by this approach is O(n3

), since it takes two loops to multiply. 

Strassen’s method was introduced to reduce the time complexity 

from O(n3

) to O(nlog 7)

The standard method of matrix multiplication of two n × n matrices takes O ( n 

3) operations. Strassen’s algorithm is a Divide-and-Conquer algorithm that is 

asymptotically faster, i.e. O (nlog 7). • The usual multiplication of two 2 × 2 

matrices takes 8 multiplications and 4 additions. Strassen showed how two 2 × 2 

matrices can be multiplied using only 7 multiplications and 18 additions.
