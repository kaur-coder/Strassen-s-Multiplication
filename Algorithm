Description of Algorithm 
Pseudo code
1. Divide matrices A and B in sub-matrices of size N/2 x N/2.
2. Calculate the 7 matrix multiplications recursively.
3. Compute the sub matrices of C.
4. Combine these sub matrices into the resultant matrix C
Strassen's Matrix Multiplication Algorithm works as follows:
 Divide: Take any two matrices which are to be multiplied, let's call them 
A and B. Split them into four smaller matrices, each about half the size of 
the original matrices.
 Calculate: Use these smaller matrices to calculate seven special values, 
which we'll call P, Q, R, S, T, U, and V. We do this by doing some simple 
additions and subtractions of the smaller matrices. The formulae are:
P = (A11 + A22)*(B11 + B22)
Q = (A21 + A22)*B11
R = A11*(B12 – B22)
S = A22*(B21 – B11)
T = (A11 + A12)*B22
U = (A21 – A11)*(B11 + B12)
V = (A12 – A22)*(B21 + B22)
 Combine: Take these seven values and use them to compute the final result 
matrix, C. The values of C are calculated using the values of P to V as 
follows:
C11 = P + S – T + V
C12 = R + T 
C21 = Q + S
C22 = P + R – Q + U
This method may sound a bit more complicated, but it's faster for really big 

matrices because it reduces the number of multiplications we need to do, even 

though it involves more additions and subtractions. For smaller matrices, the 

regular multiplication is faster, but for huge matrices, Strassen's method can save 

a lot of time.

There are some conditions for Strassen’s algorithm to work.

1. Both input matrices should be of dimensions n x n.

2. n should be a power of 2.

If the above conditions are not satisfied, we must pad the matrices with 0 to satisfy 

the above conditions.
